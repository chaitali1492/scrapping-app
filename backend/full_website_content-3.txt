Case Study: Transforming Dental Imaging with AI – A Computer Vision Success
### **Project Overview**
We recently had the opportunity to push the boundaries of healthcare innovation through a cutting-edge Computer Vision project focused on dental imaging. This end-to-end solution was designed to automate and optimize the process of analyzing dental impressions — a crucial step in modern dental diagnostics and treatment planning.
### **Problem Statement**
Dental clinics and labs often work with a high volume of images, but:  

- Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone.  
- Image quality varies, affecting diagnostic accuracy.  
- Detecting dental impressions requires expert intervention.  
We set out to build a fully automated, intelligent system to improve speed, accuracy, and consistency in dental image analysis.  

### **Solution Delivered**
We engineered an AI-powered workflow with the following components. 


**1. Dental Impression Object Detection**
Using deep learning-based detection models (such as YOLO and EfficientDet), we trained the system to accurately identify dental impressions in various image conditions. The model was fine-tuned on a diverse dataset, achieving high precision and recall scores in detecting impressions amidst complex backgrounds.  


**2. Image Quality Assessment**
To ensure diagnostic-grade results, we integrated an image quality evaluator that analysed. 

- Sharpness: Using edge detection and focus metrics. 

- Brightness: Normalizing underexposed or overexposed images.
- Only images meeting the quality threshold progressed to the next step, ensuring consistent outputs and reducing false positives.

**3. End-to-End Automation Pipeline**
From the moment an image is uploaded, our system:
- Validates and enhances image quality. 
- Detects the presence of dental impressions.
- Flags any issues for review.  
- Outputs results in a standardised format.


All this happens without manual intervention, drastically reducing turnaround time.
### **Impact & Benefits**

- Efficiency Boost: Reduced processing time by 75%.
- High Accuracy: >95% precision in detecting valid impressions.
- Consistency: Automated quality control ensures uniform diagnostic standards.
- Scalability: The pipeline can handle hundreds of images per hour with minimal hardware.


### **Collaboration & Teamwork**
This project was a true testament to team collaboration and interdisciplinary expertise — combining data science, machine learning, software engineering, and dental imaging knowledge.
