#  FastAPI Vector Search with MongoDB & OpenAI

This project is a simple question-answering system using **FastAPI**, **MongoDB**, and **OpenAI Embeddings**.

It works like this:
1. Text is broken into chunks and stored in MongoDB with their **OpenAI embeddings**.
2. When you ask a question, its embedding is calculated.
3. The app finds the **top 3 similar chunks** from MongoDB.
4. These chunks are sent to **OpenAI GPT model** to generate the final answer.
